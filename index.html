        <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) was an Indian mathematician who made significant contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Despite having almost no formal training in mathematics, he independently discovered many complex theorems and formulas.</p>
        <h2>Education:</h2>
        <p>Ramanujan's formal education in mathematics was limited. He attended local schools in Kumbakonam, India, where he displayed an extraordinary talent for mathematics from a young age. Due to financial constraints, Ramanujan could not afford to pursue higher education immediately after completing his schooling.</p>
        <p>However, his passion for mathematics led him to study advanced mathematical textbooks on his own. He delved into topics such as number theory, trigonometry, and calculus, often discovering new results independently.</p>
        <h2>Key Theories:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ramanujan Prime:</strong> Ramanujan discovered a class of numbers called "Ramanujan primes," which are certain prime numbers that have unique properties.</li>
            <li><strong>Ramanujan Conjecture:</strong> He formulated various conjectures, including the Ramanujan conjecture, which deals with the properties of highly divisible numbers.</li>
            <li><strong>Modular Forms:</strong> Ramanujan made significant contributions to the theory of modular forms, which have applications in various areas of mathematics, including number theory and algebraic geometry.</li>
            <li><strong>Mock Theta Functions:</strong> He developed the theory of mock theta functions, which are related to the theory of modular forms and have connections to other areas of mathematics, such as combinatorics and special functions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Key Contributions:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Discovered the infinite series for pi (Ï€).</li>
            <li>Identified the mathematical properties of the partition function.</li>
            <li>Contributed to the theory of elliptic functions.</li>
            <li>Formulated conjectures and identities involving prime numbers.</li>
            <li>Developed the mock theta functions.</li>
            <li>Worked extensively on mathematical analysis and continued fractions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Awards and Recognition:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ramanujan was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1918, one of the youngest Fellows in history.</li>
            <li>He was awarded the Fellow of the Trinity College, Cambridge, for his remarkable contributions to mathematics.</li>
            <li>The Ramanujan Prize, established by the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), is awarded annually to young mathematicians who have conducted outstanding research in developing countries.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Legacy:</h2>
        <p>Ramanujan's notebooks, containing his unpublished work and theories, have been the subject of extensive study and research even after his death. They continue to inspire mathematicians and researchers worldwide.</p>
        <p>Several theorems and formulas discovered by Ramanujan have found applications in various branches of mathematics, physics, and engineering.</p>
        <p>Ramanujan's life story and achievements have been depicted in numerous books, documentaries, and films, inspiring future generations of mathematicians and scientists.</p>
